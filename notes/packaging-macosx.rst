Packaging Reaktoro in MacOSX
============================

Firstly, make sure you have Xcode installed. Then, open Xcode, and go to 
`Xcode → Open Developer Tool → More Developer Tools...` and search for 
*Auxiliary Tools for Xcode*. Download `Auxiliary Tools for Xcode - Late July 2012`, 
since the later versions do not ship with `PackageMaker`.

Open the downloaded file, search for `PackageMaker` and copy it to Applications. 
After this, CPack will be able to pack Reaktoro executables and libraries into a MacOSX installer.

The guidelines for setting up CPack variables can be found [here](https://cmake.org/Wiki/CMake:Component_Install_With_CPack).
